1. We need to save things on the stack before we call jal so that the data isn't lost, as the registers can be overwritten
2. add t0, s0, x0 loads the address of s0 into t0, whereas lw t0, 0(s0) loads the value at s0. So this was a bug
3. Reading the pointer means reading the value at the location of the pointer
4. Need to increment the array by 4 bytes at a time
5. Need to stop t1 from being overwritten
6. Another bug regarding lw vs add
